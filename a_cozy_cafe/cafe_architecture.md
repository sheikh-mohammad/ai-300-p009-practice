# Cozy Café Architecture Design

## Overview
A complete architectural design for a cozy café specifically designed for students to study quietly. This document integrates all components of the café into a cohesive, functional space that maintains the study-friendly atmosphere while ensuring efficient operations.

## Space Layout & Design Philosophy

### Overall Concept
The Cozy Café is designed as a sanctuary for students, featuring a 12-seat capacity with distinct zones that cater to different study needs while maintaining a unified, peaceful atmosphere. The architecture emphasizes natural materials, warm lighting, and acoustic comfort.

### Design Principles
- **Minimal and clean aesthetic** throughout all spaces
- **Natural wood furniture** as the primary material
- **Soft color palette** (creams, warm grays, sage greens, light beiges)
- **Warm lighting** (2700K-3000K temperature) without harsh white lights
- **Acoustic comfort** with sound-dampening materials
